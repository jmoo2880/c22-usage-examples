# *catch22* Python Usage Examples
*catch22* is a subset of the 22 best performing time-series features, distilled from over 7000 features in [hctsa](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa).
The primary purpose of this repository is to guide new users through the practical utilisation of *catch22* within their Python-based time-series
analysis workflows. 

# *catch22* Feature Descriptions




# Additional Implementations
While this repository specifically focuses on the Python (pyCatch22) implementation, *catch22* is avilable in multiple languages. Further details about the Julia ([Catch22.jl](https://github.com/brendanjohnharris/Catch22.jl)), R ([Rcatch22](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22)) and MATLAB implementations of *catch22* can be found in the original
[repository](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/catch22) and [wiki](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/catch22/wiki/Installation-and-Testing).
