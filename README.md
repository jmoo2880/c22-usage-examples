# *catch22* Python Usage Examples
__*catch22*__ is a subset of the 22 best-performing time-series features, distilled from a comprehensive library of over 7000 time-series features in [hctsa](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa).
The purpose of this repository is to guide new users through the practical utilisation of *catch22* within their Python-based time-series
analysis workflows.

To get started, you'll need to install the latest version of *pycatch22* via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pycatch22/):

```python 
pip install pycatch22
```

# ðŸ“š Notebook Descriptions 
The *catch22* usage examples are organised as individual Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a different application.
- *catch22_pandas_example.ipynb*


# ðŸ“– *catch22* Feature Descriptions 
For a more in-depth understanding of the time-series features comprising *catch22*, a clear and intuitive explanation of each feature can be found in the *catch22* [GitBook](https://feature-based-time-series-analys.gitbook.io/catch22-features/), including relevant examples and plots.
A high-level summary of the time-series feature names, conceptual groupings, and brief descriptions are also provided in a [feature overview table](https://feature-based-time-series-analys.gitbook.io/catch22-features/feature-overview-table). 

# ðŸ’» Additional Implementations 
While this repository specifically focuses on the Python (pycatch22) implementation, *catch22* is available in multiple languages. Further details about the Julia ([Catch22.jl](https://github.com/brendanjohnharris/Catch22.jl)), R ([Rcatch22](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22)) and MATLAB implementations of *catch22* can be found in the original
[repository](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/catch22) and [wiki](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/catch22/wiki/Installation-and-Testing).
