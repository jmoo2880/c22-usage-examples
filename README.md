# *catch22* Python Usage Examples
*catch22* is a subset of the 22 best performing time-series features, distilled from over 7000 features in [hctsa](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa).
This repository specifically focuses on the practical implementation of *catch22* in python (pyCatch22).

# Additional Implementations
While this repository focuses on the Python implementation, *catch22* is avilable in multiple languages.
Further details about the Julia ([Catch22.jl](https://github.com/brendanjohnharris/Catch22.jl)) and R ([Rcatch22](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22)) implementations of *catch22* can be found in the original *catch22*
[repository](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/catch22) and [wiki](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/catch22/wiki/Installation-and-Testing).
